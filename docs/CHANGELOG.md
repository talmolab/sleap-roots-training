# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- The wandb credential guard (`seed-registry --execute` / `--verify`) now accepts a resolvable
  wandb credential — `WANDB_API_KEY` **or** a netrc entry for `api.wandb.ai` written by
  `wandb login` — instead of requiring `WANDB_API_KEY`. The netrc file is located the way wandb
  locates it (`NETRC` env var, else `~/.netrc`, else `~/_netrc`), so a login session is honored on
  every platform (including Windows `~/_netrc`). Fail-fast with a clear error is retained when no
  credential is resolvable anywhere; a malformed netrc — or a netrc entry with a blank/absent
  password — is treated as "no credential" (mirroring wandb's own resolver), so a stale login fails
  before the confirmation prompt rather than deep inside `wandb.init()`.

### Added
- Shared test-fixture layer (`tests/conftest.py`) with `tiny_matrix`, `stub_models_root`,
  `isolate_wandb_env` (clears the wandb/registry env vars **and** `NETRC` and repoints
  `HOME`/`USERPROFILE`), and TF-reference payload loaders.
- Committed TensorFlow reference baseline: the `config`/`summary` of the seven canonical
  `20250625_cyl_arabidopsis_primary_receptive_field` runs under `tests/fixtures/tf_reference/`
  (captured by `scripts/pull_tf_reference.py`), documented in `docs/tf-reference.md` and locked by
  `tests/test_tf_reference.py`. The group is a `max_stride` sweep, not a replicate set; `oks_map` is
  excluded as broken and the observability gap (no per-epoch logging) is recorded for Tier 1.
- `sleap-roots-training seed-registry`: seed the production wandb model registry from the
  committed selection matrix. Publishes the current legacy root models as `type="model"`
  artifacts with flat `ModelCard` selection metadata and the `production` alias — the
  surface the `sleap-roots-predict` warm worker reads. Defaults to a dry run; `--execute`
  (with `--yes`/`--force`/`--only`) publishes; `--verify` re-runs the consumer read path.
- `sleap_roots_training.registry` package: env-driven config, the provenance-stamped
  `model_selection.yaml` (7 rows → 13 cards over 8 SHA256-pinned models), card expansion,
  legacy-model resolution (SHA256-verified unzip), run-config lineage, and the
  publish/link/verify helpers.
- Runtime deps `wandb` and `sleap-roots-contracts`.

## [0.0.1a0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- Initial repository scaffold: package skeleton, CLI entry point
  (`sleap-roots-training --help`), test suite, CI, and OpenSpec setup.
